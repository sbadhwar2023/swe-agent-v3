## Custom SWE Agents in This Repository

The current repository (`sweagent-v3`) contains several custom SWE agent implementations with increasing complexity and capabilities:

1. **Basic** (`swe_agent.py`) - Basic functionality with limited tools
2. **Enhanced** (`swe_agent_enhanced.py`) - Expanded tool set (12 tools)
3. **Interactive** (`swe_agent_interactive_enhanced.py`) - Added user interaction
4. **Claude Style** (`swe_agent_claude_style.py`) - Visual formatting like Claude Code
5. **Persistent** (`swe_agent_persistent.py`) - Error recovery and state persistence
6. **Summarization** (`swe_agent_enhanced_summarization.py`) - Complete solution with context management

The most advanced implementation (`swe_agent_enhanced_summarization.py`) offers:
- Full tool suite
- Persistent state across failures
- Intelligent summarization
- Progress tracking
- Error recovery
- Context management

## How Our Agents Compare to Market Solutions

| Feature | Our Best Agent | Market Leaders | Differentiator |
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Autonomy | Medium-High | High (Devin) | Our agents focus on reliability over full autonomy |
| Error Recovery | Excellent | Variable | Our persistent agents have superior error recovery |
| Tool Integration | Comprehensive | Specialized | Our agents offer more general-purpose tools |
| Context Management | Strong | Variable | Our summarization approach prevents context overflow |
| Progress Tracking | Detailed | Limited | Our progress.md generation is more comprehensive |
| Accessibility | Open Source | Mixed | Fully transparent implementation |
| User Interaction | Flexible | Variable | Multiple interaction patterns available |

## Conclusion

The landscape of SWE agents offers a spectrum from simple code assistants to fully autonomous developers. While commercial solutions like Devin promise the highest level of autonomy, open-source alternatives provide more transparency and customization.

Our custom SWE agents in this repository represent a comprehensive approach with a focus on reliability, error recovery, and context management - areas where many market solutions still struggle. The persistent error recovery and intelligent summarization capabilities make our agents particularly well-suited for complex, long-running development tasks.

For most development scenarios, we recommend:
- `swe_agent_persistent.py` for day-to-day development tasks
- `swe_agent_enhanced_summarization.py` for complex, production-level work

However, for specialized needs like IDE integration or GitHub issue resolution, market solutions like Continue or Sweep may be more appropriate.
